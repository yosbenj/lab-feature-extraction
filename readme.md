# Lab | Feature extraction

For this lab, we will be using the same dataset we used in the previous labs. We recommend using the same notebook since you will be reusing the same variables you previous created and used in labs. 

## Data Analysis Process
#### Remember the process:

- Case Study
- Get data
- **Cleaning/Wrangling/EDA**
- Processing Data
- Modeling
 -Validation
- Reporting

### Instructions

1. Open the `categorical` dataframe we created before.
2. Plot all the categorical variables with the proper plot. What can you see?
3. There might be some columns that seem to be redundant, check their values to be sure. What should we do with them?  
    Make any changes you feel are necessary.
4. Plot time variable. Can you extract something from it?
5. The time variable can be useful. You shoud transform its data into a more useful form.
    Hint: Day, week, and month as integers might be useful.
